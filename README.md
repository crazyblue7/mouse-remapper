# mouse-remapper
This is just a simple mouse remapper written in C++, because i wanted to use something called
X-Mouse Button Control (oficial site: https://www.xmousebuttoncontrol.com/),
but i was using linux, and X-Mouse Button Control is only for Windows,
so i wrote a mouse button remapper to use in linux.
# how do i use the mouse remapper aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Go to the releases tab, in the assets for the latest release, just download
the apropriate ZIP file for linux, or Windows. Extract the ZIP, and run the EXE (for windows), or the
executable file (for linux).
